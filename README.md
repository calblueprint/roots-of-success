**[Roots of Success](rootsofsuccess.org)** is a non-profit organization using a non-traditional curriculum to teach underserved people the skills they need to find jobs and careers in STEM fields. With over 10,000 graduates in 35 states, Puerto Rico, South Africa, and the UK, Roots of Success is one of the leaders in providing education to those who need it the most.

What We Are Doing
----
Currently, Roots of Success makes use of a grab bag of technologies each with its own use case but unable to cohere to provide a unified experience for teachers. Because of this, we are developing a teacher portal where teachers can access course content online and provide feedback about their classes all in one place. We are also developing analytics so that the organization is able to better serve its rapidly growing user base.

**[Cal Blueprint](http://www.calblueprint.org/)** is a student-run UC Berkeley organization devoted to matching the skills of its members to our desire to see social good enacted in our community. Each semester, teams of 4-5 students work closely with a non-profit to bring technological solutions to the problems they face every day.
