/* GENERAL STYLE GUIDE: Use these sass variables for consistent style.

COLORS:
$blue: #477DCA
$dark-gray: #333
$medium-gray: #999
$light-gray: #DDD
(Use white for white)

FONTS:
$header-font-family: $montserrat;
$base-font-family: $sans-serif;

GENERAL COMMENTS:
1) All content possible should be within the grid system. This means inside a column class that's inside a
   row class. Very sparingly use content not inside the grid system, with the exception of banners and
   spacers. Banners and spacers are detailed later in this file. However, of course there are a
   few exceptions. Just try your best!
2) Text in headlines and paragraphs should be mostly centered by using the center class when neccesary.
   When writing the actual text, try to write it so that the middle part extends further than the top and
   bottoms, like a barrel.
3) Outside of banners, of which you should only be using one a page at most, images should have padding
   between each other.
4) For now let's stay away from JS and CSS transitions (except when used for something we've specifically
   designated for animation). We'll add in effects later but it's important to have a solid layout first.
